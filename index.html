            <h1>What is Oracle Station?<br>
            </h1>

            <p> We are a medium RP Space Station13 server running on our own fork of the /tg/station code. Some differences include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Reworked security. Rather than having individual cells, criminals are placed in one large cell called genpop. This simplifies the brigging process while giving criminals and antagonists some windows to keep things interesting.</li>
                    <li>A more in-depth medical system from Baystation12, featuring broken bones, organ damage, and more forms of misery.</li>
                    <li>Slower movement speed. Oracle's movement speed is more in line with Paradise or Colonial Marines movement speed, allowing for more strategic than executional play. Because of this, we've had to tweak the speeds of NPCs in places sch as Lavaland, which is currently slightly harder than TG's version of Lavaland.</li>
                    <li>IPCs, our own version of the machine people from Baystation and Paradise. They are easily damaged, yet easily repairable with items commonly found around the station, like wire or a welding tool. However, they are extremely weak to EMPs. Unlike other servers, EMPs on Oracle do not cause instant death. Instead, they cause limbs to malfunction, along with some damage. Because of our human-enforced command and Asimov AI lawset, IPCs are not permitted to play a command role.</li>
                </ul>

            <p>The Oracle codebase is maintained by a team of talented SS13 developers with help from the community. A declicious blend of roleplay, action, and standard SS13 silliness, Oracle Station is a station sure to please.
